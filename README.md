# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the Data Scientist job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the Job Titles for the top-paying Data Scientist role?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for Data Scientist?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal tools and languages to learn if you would like to pursue a career as a data sciencties ?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the Data Scientist role job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the Data Scientist role in the job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Scientist Jobs titles
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered Data Scientist positions by average yearly salary. This query highlights the job titles which are idenitfied as Data Scientist which are the highest paying opportunities in the field.

```sql

	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```


Here's the breakdown of the top Data Scientist jobs in 2023:

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT	
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
HAVING COUNT(*) > 50
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
