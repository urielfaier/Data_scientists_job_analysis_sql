Answer: What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka itâ€™s in high demand and a high-paying skill)?
- Identify skills in high demand and associated with high average salaries for Data Scientist roles
- Why? Targets skills that offer job security (high demand) and financial benefits (high salaries), 
    offering strategic insights for career development in Data Science.
